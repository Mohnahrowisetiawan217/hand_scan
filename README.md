# Hand Scan
## Hand scanner gimmik inspiration by @DanangKumara. 

Hand Scanner Video Fail refers to a viral video in which Mohammad Ramdhan Pomanto, the Mayor of Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, touched a television screen with the outline of a handprint, as if the television was scanning his hand. However, the screen didn't have a touch screen function, and the animation that played after he "scanned" his hand was shown to be a video after the video player UI accidentally appeared when he touched it. The video became a source of edits and redraws on social media.
